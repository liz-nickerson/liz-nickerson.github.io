<h2>Yield to Pedestrians</h2>

Yield to Pedestrians is a four-piece punk band based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. They currently have a Facebook page that they use to keep in contact with their followers, but no website. A website might allow them to reach more listeners and increase their legitimacy as professional group of musicians.

<h2>William Nickerson Antiques</h2>

William Nickerson Antiques is a small antique dealership based in Orleans, Massachusetts that currently does not have a website. A website would help them promote the business, advertise upcoming events, and keep in contact with prospective buyers.

<h2>Bangkok Kitchen</h2>

Bangkok Kitchen is a small Thai restaurant in Hyannis, Massachusetts, owned and operated by a staff of about six cooks and servers. Situated near Barnstable airport, it's well-known by frequent Cape Air flyers, but overlooked my many locals and tourists alike. A website would serve to increase the restaurant's presence in the community.

<h2>Booksmith Musicsmith</h2>

Booksmith Musicsmith is an independent bookstore in Orleans, Massachusetts and does not currently have a website. Booksmith Musicsmith is a staple of the local community, but struggles to compete with both chain bookstores, like Barnes&Noble, and online realtors, like Amazon. A website would serve to increase their volume of business through an online catalogue. 

<h3>Proposed web pages:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Home</li>
	<li>About</li>
	<li>Shop Books</li>
	<li>Shop Music</li>
	<li>Events</li>
</ul>
