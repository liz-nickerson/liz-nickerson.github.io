		<p>
My name is Liz and I'm a second semester senior at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, expecting to graduate in May 2017. Upon graduation I will receive my Bachelor of Arts in English with a letter of specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in technical writing, with a focus in user experience and design. For more information, check out my <a href="exercise2.html">resume</a>.

I'm passionate about the intersection of art and technology, and I'm excited to work a field that values both. I'm an avid reader a spreadsheet fanatic. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, macro photography, and watching movies.
