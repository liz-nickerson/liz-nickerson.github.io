Word for Antique Dealers
</a>
<br>
During my <a class="inline" href="http://www.umass.edu/pwtc/380/index.html" target="blank">software documentation course (ENGL 380)</a>, I composed a task-based user guide to Microsoft Word 2016 for Windows. A component of this project involved choosing an audience and researching their goals as end users.

<br>
As part of my Introduction to Professional Writing course (ENGL 379), I was required to compose a grant proposal. The purpose of this assignment was to represent a non-profit and seek funding from an established foundation in order to complete a project. In this document, you might find Section 3 (a description of the project's proposed work) to be most relevant.
