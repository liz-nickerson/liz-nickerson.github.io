			<p class="banddesc">
				Yield To Pedestrians are a four-piece indie punk band from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
				Started in 2012, Yield To Pedestrians formed during the band members' senior year of high school
					after front man, Spencer Hill, moved to Cape Cod from Charlotte, North Carolina.
				Prior, Yield To Pedestrians operated as a funk and jazz combo, called WHAT.
				Yield To Pedestrians repertoire consists of original songs,
					as well as covers that they play for inspiration.
				Currently, Yield To Pedestrians are in the process of recording their first album,
					which will feature mixed versions of many songs from their live recordings at the historic Wellfleet Preservation Hall.
